# hello-world
I'm trying to make my first Android app (using Android Studio), which I want to use for communication with my devices via HC-05 Bluetooth interface.

The problem is that, although I have programming experience, my programming skills are mostly in assemblers and od programming languages, like Basic, C/C#, Fortran, etc.

At start, I'd like to create simple program, which can read messages sent from external source via HC-05 bluetooth interface...
